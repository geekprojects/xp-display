XP Display
==========

Welcome to XP Display, an open source project to build high-fidelity airplane simulator instruments for X-Plane. This project is a fork of the [XHSI](https://xhsi.sourceforge.net/) project.

(Note, I put about 2 seconds in to the name of this fork, it may clash with other projects or I may think of something better. It's subject to change!)

Done
---
* Add CMake file to simplify building of the plugin (Mac only so far)
* Add pom.xml to make building the App easier

TODO
---
* X-Plane 12 support
  * It will run with X-Plane 12 but has warnings about changes to Data Refs.
* Linux support for CMake files
* Windows support for CMake files
  * I don't have access to a Windows development machine, you're welcome to submit a Pull Request :-)
